# 42testers
Testers for some of the 42 cursus projects, will be updating with time.
These testers are specially focused on error handling.

Please keep in mind that i can (and probably will) make mistakes, so these testers are not entirely failsafe :)


Idk if I really need to say this, but Disclaimer: passing these testers does not mean you will pass the project and viceversa,
besides, these testers are more focused toward the evaluator so they don't need to spend so much time trying all tests.
Similarly, as an evaluator, you cannot show up, run this, and call it a day, it is your job to understand the tests being made (and make sure they are correct)

# How to use
Clone the repo and move the files (only the ones for the project, obviously, since you'll be cloning all the testers) where the main project is, run the script with ```bash test_PROJECT.sh```

Have fun, and happy coding!
